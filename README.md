# Rock Paper Scissors
A small domain model implementing the simple game of
Rock Paper Scissors. The aim was to treat the game
as a Domain Driven Design exercise: how can we
represent the rules of the game in a way that is
transparent within the code itself?

Included is a command line script for running the
game against the computer (which just randomizes
its choice each time).

# Requirements
* PHP 7.2+
